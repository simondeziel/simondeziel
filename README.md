### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<img align="right" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=simondeziel"/>

I am a system/network administrator that specializes in Linux. System automation is my favorite topic. I also have a particular interest in security related topics like hardening, Apparmor confinement, containerization, VPNs, DNSSEC, etc.

I've started my Linux journey in ~2002 and I've been working with open source software from the comfort of my home since 2010.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

Most of my free time is shared between improving my home infrastructure and contributing to Ubuntu through [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~sdeziel) and more recently Debian through [Salsa](https://salsa.debian.org/sdeziel-guest).
